Hextime is a watchface for the [Pebble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)) smartwatch that displays the time in hexadecimal. It was developed using the Pebble SDK. It's written in C and was published to the Pebble appstore. Unfortunately in 2016 Pebble Technology filed for insolvency but the app can still be downloaded thanks to the awesome work by [rebble.io](https://rebble.io/).
